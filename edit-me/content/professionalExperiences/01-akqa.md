**Major NZ retail chain online shopping website**

Technologies: .NET, Sitecore 10.1 (SXA, SPE), ASP.NET MVC, GitLab, Docker/Kubernetes\

Goal: The project required building from scratch an online store for purchasing retail products with delivery for a major supermarket chain. One of the longest project I've worked so far (6 years), worked in a different roles starting as Senior Sitecore Developer and finishing as Technical Lead. As the project load scaled I was working on optimizing performance due to website traffic growing fast, adding new features, upgrading the Sitecore versions (from 9 to 10, and from 10 PaaS to 10.2.1 on Docker).\
Result: The project work was completed on time, and we succesfully accomodated growing load and traffic on one of the most popular NZ online supermarket website.

**Major NZ government banking-sector website**

Technologies: .NET, Sitecore 9.2 (SXA), ASP.NET MVC, TeamCity, Docker/Kubernetes

Goal: Build a corporate website with information about NZ banking. Due to domain the solution required additional security considerations for CMS editing to minimize the danger of any unauthorized edit.\
Result: The project was completed in time; all functionality was well-tested and documented.
